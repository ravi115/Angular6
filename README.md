**To Generate the new Angular project:**

          - ng new <projectName>
- This will create a new angular projecct with the project name supplied.
- Since it is also a npm projecct it will download all the npm modules.
- The project structure goes as below: 

        - ProjectName
            - e2e
            - node_modules
            - src
            - .editorconfig
            - .gitignore
            - angular.json
            - package.json
            - README.md
            - tsconfig.json
            - tslint.json
